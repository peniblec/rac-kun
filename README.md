RAC-kun - junior version of RAC


Overview
================================================================================

This is a prototype for RAC, a freerider-resilient, scalable, anonymous
communication protocol conceived by researchers from CNRS and LIG.

Implemented features:
- Join procedure
- Ring structure

Implementing:
- Groups and channels

Not implemented:
- ID and pseudonym key pairs
- ID computation
- Onion routing
- Checking for misbehaviour


Requirements
================================================================================

Dependencies:
- Boost 1.49
- Crypto++ 5.6.1


Development notes
================================================================================

Current feature being implemented: groups and channels

What's done:
- The notion of group and channel exists
- *Network* has a list of groups sorted by ID
- JOIN Notification (resp. Acknowledgements) features a *group_id* field, which
  corresponds to the group the new node should be sorted into (resp. the node
  the acknowledger belongs to)
- Broadcast messages have a channel marker which indicate in which rings they
  are circulating
- Likewise, *Network* has a map associating a channel marker with the
  corresponding group ID
- JOIN Notification and Acknowledgements are (*should be*) interpreted correctly
  whether the new node is currently joining its group or the surrounding
  channels
    - NB: *JoinNotification* has a *CHANNEL* flag which indicates whether the
      node is only joining its own group, or the other channels.
      Consider a scenario where the entry point *e*, belonging to group
      G<sub>e</sub>, sorts the new node *n* into group G<sub>n</sub>: *e* will
      have to use the < G<sub>e</sub> - G<sub>n</sub> > channel to send the JOIN
      Notif to G<sub>n</sub>, and we don't want members of G<sub>e</sub> to send
      JOIN Acknowledgements yet; hence the *CHANNEL* flag

What's not done:
- When the new node has finished joining its group, it does not initiate any
  procedure to join the surrounding channels (and discover the other groups out
  there). Possible solutions:
    - 
- When the group goes beyond its maximum size, nothing happens. Possible 
  solutions: (coming)   
- When the group goes below its minimum size, nothing happens. Possible
  solutions: (coming)
