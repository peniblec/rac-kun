RAC-kun - junior version of RAC


Overview
================================================================================

This is a prototype for RAC, a freerider-resilient, scalable, anonymous
communication protocol conceived by researchers from CNRS and LIG.

Implemented features:
- Join procedure
- Ring structure

Implementing:
- Groups and channels

Not implemented:
- ID and pseudonym key pairs
- ID computation
- Onion routing
- Checking for misbehaviour
- A real CLI


Installing & Running
================================================================================

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dependencies:
- Boost (1.42+)
    - http://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/
- Crypto++ (5.6.1+)
    - http://www.cryptopp.com/

The program will look for headers in `/usr/include` and for library files in
`/usr/lib`. These paths may be changed in the *makefile* that you will find in
the same folder as this readme.

Other requirements:
- This program was developped on Debian 6.0.7 (squeeze), so it should work on
  other OSes based on the Linux kernel (from version 2.6.32-5-686 onward)
- The program assumes that a direct TCP connection may be established between
  two clients, and does not handle any obstruction (NAT, firewall, relay server,
  proxy...)

Once the aforementioned libraries have been installed, you can run `make` in the
same directory as this readme and the program will be compiled into an
executable file named *node*.

Usage

Development Notes
================================================================================

Current feature being implemented: groups and channels

What's done:
- The notions of group and channel exist
- *Network* has a list of groups sorted by ID
- JOIN Notification (resp. Acknowledgements) features a *group_id* field, which
  corresponds to the group the new node should be sorted into (resp. the node
  the acknowledger belongs to)
- Broadcast messages have a channel marker which indicates in which rings they
  are circulating
- Likewise, *Network* has a map associating a channel marker with the
  corresponding group ID
- JOIN Notification and Acknowledgements are ( *should be* ) interpreted
  correctly whether the new node is currently joining its group or the
  surrounding channels
    - NB: *JoinNotification* has a *CHANNEL* flag which indicates whether the
      node is only joining its own group, or the other channels.
      Consider a scenario where the entry point *e*, belonging to group
      G<sub>e</sub>, sorts the new node *n* into group G<sub>n</sub>: *e* will
      have to use the < G<sub>e</sub> - G<sub>n</sub> > channel to send the JOIN
      Notif to G<sub>n</sub>, and we don't want members of G<sub>e</sub> to send
      JOIN Acknowledgements yet; hence the *CHANNEL* flag

What's not done:
- When the new node has finished joining its group, it does not initiate any
  procedure to join the surrounding channels (and discover the other groups out
  there). Possible solution: (2, 3 and 5 are already implemented)
    1.  either the new node *n*, the entry point, or someone from the new node's
        group starts broadcasting a new JOIN Notif (with the *CHANNEL* flag on)
    2.  all nodes not in *n*'s group will add *n* to their view of its group,
        and update their channel rings ; they will also send JOIN Acks to *n*
    3.  all nodes in *n*'s group will add *n* to all their channels, and update
        the rings 
    4.  the guy from 1. will send READY to *n*
    5.  *n* will only send READY Notifs to members of the other groups

- When the group goes beyond its maximum size, nothing happens. Possible 
  solution:
    1.  after a JOIN procedure is completed, *some node* checks whether the
        group size is too high (if the check is made before the procedure ends,
        only the entry point knows that the group size will get too high, so
        other nodes have no way to check the entry point's claim that a new node
        is joining
    2.  this node broadcasts SPLIT(old group ID) in all channels
    3.  every node computes the ID for the two new groups
        - nodes in the old group compute their new group and channel rings
        - nodes in other groups compute their new channel rings

- When the group goes below its minimum size, nothing happens. Possible
  solution:
    1.  when a member quits, *some node* checks whether the size of group G went
        below the minimal size
    2.  this node broadcasts MERGE(G<sub>old</sub>) in all channels
    3.  for every node *n* in any group G<sub>n</sub>
        - compute where every node of G<sub>old</sub> is dispatched (build a
          list L<sub>G</sub> of the "foster groups" they're joining)
        - if *n* belongs to G<sub>old</sub>,
            - compute rings in his new group
        - else if *n* belongs to a foster group,
            - compute the new group rings in G<sub>n</sub>
        - compute new channel rings between G<sub>n</sub> and any group in
          L<sub>G</sub>
